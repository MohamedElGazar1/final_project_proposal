*Insightful Analysis of IT Salaries Across Europe*

## 📍 Overview  
This project aims to analyze Job tilte and salary trends among IT professionals in various European countries over a three-year period using data collected from anonymous annual surveys. The goal is to extract meaningful insights into how factors like experience, job role, location, and tech stack influence compensation across the continent.

The dataset spans three years:
- IT Salary Survey EU 2018.csv
- T Salary Survey EU 2019.csv
- IT Salary Survey EU 2020.csv

Each file contains anonymized responses from IT professionals, offering valuable information on demographics, job roles, salaries, company types, and etc...

## 🔍 Objectives
- merge and clean datasets from 2018, 2019, and 2020.
- Identify key patterns and correlations between salary and professional attributes.
- Visualize geographic and occupational trends in IT earnings.
- Compare salary growth year-over-year.
- Provide actionable insights for HR departments, job seekers, and policymakers.

## 🛠 Technical Approach

### 1. *Data Cleaning*
- Handle missing or inconsistent values (e.g., drop or impute).
- Convert currency and numeric fields to uniform formats.
- Clean categorical variables (e.g., unify "Java" vs "java", "Full-stack" vs "Fullstack").
- Remove outliers using statistical methods like IQR or Z-score.

### 2. *Feature Engineering*
- Derive new metrics such as:
  - *Salary per year of experience*
  - *Total Compensation = Base Salary + Bonus*
  - *Experience-to-Salary Ratio*
- Encode categorical features:
  - Use *One-Hot Encoding* for nominal categories (e.g., city, industry)
  - Use *Ordinal Encoding* for ordered categories (e.g., seniority levels)

### 3. *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)*
- Calculate summary statistics (mean, median, min/max salaries).
- Analyze salary distributions by:
  - Country/City
  - Job Role
  - Experience Level
  - Tech Stack
- Explore relationships using correlation matrices and scatter plots.
- Create grouped visualizations (e.g., average salary per job title in each country).

### 4. *Visualization Strategy*
- Use *Matplotlib, **Seaborn, and optionally **Plotly* for:
  - Heatmaps showing salary distribution across cities
  - Bar charts comparing top-paying roles
  - Line graphs tracking salary changes over time
  - Boxplots analyzing salary spread by experience level
  - Cluster maps identifying high-tech hubs

## 📦 Deliverables
- A cleaned and merged dataset 
- Colab containing EDA and visualization code
- Final report summarizing findings and trends
- Optional: Interactive dashboard using Plotly/Dash or Streamlit
